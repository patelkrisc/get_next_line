# get_next_line
The project get_next_line is straight forward and leaves very little room for bonuses, but I am sure that you have a lot of imagination. If you ace perfectly the mandatory part, then by all means complete this bonus part to go furher. I repeat, no bonus will be taken into consideration if the mandatory part isn’t perfect. • To succeed get_next_line with a single static variable. • To be able to manage multiple file descriptor with your get_next_line. For ex- ample, if the file descriptors 3, 4 and 5 are accessible for reading, then you can call get_next_line once on 3, once on 4, once again on 3 then once on 5 etc. without losing the reading thread on each of the descriptors.
